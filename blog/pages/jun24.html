								 Happy bayram folk! I hope you all are having a wonderful one, and lets pretend the site coming back on this day is your special , special present 
				, for you! So since my last post and the site going temporarily down, you might be asking what has being going on in my life? Well, I have finished my Gcse's 
				meaning I'm on my way to college now, hopefully with the right grades to get into the one i choose. I have also taken up walks to attempt to improve my mood, 
				chronic onlineness and to make myself less fucking chubby.  But to be honest i'm not really enjoying the walks and not because of the task of excercising, 
				they just don't feel happy make me feel to happy. I'm gonna chalk this up to the uk weather and me being a lil' sad that my secondary school education is
				 over and that i wont be able to see a lot of ppl I have known for the past 5 years, but hey, every ending means a new beginning! Oh I plan to revamp the gallery at some point because to me it just looks so
				 awful.

				<br><br>

				Now as another bayram present, please enjoy this clip I took oy my favourite part of my walks so far. People doing donuts in my local alotments carpark. (Which I could hear them from an actual mile away lol)
