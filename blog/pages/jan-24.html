				<p>I know not many ppl visit my site, but in the off-chance you recently tried visiting my site on the main domain,  I took my site offline and said it would it be back by December.... Well yh, long story short, I was having problems with my laptop so I couldnt do much during the holiday's. But we're back now! So what did I add? Not much, all I did was steal zonelet's css and add a gallery using https://netfriend.neocities.org/ez-gallery/
				<span class="gap"></span> <span class="gap"></span> P.S i will right about some stuff that happened in Turkiye but rn im too friggin lazy
				<span class="gap"></span> <span class="gap"></span> P.S P.S i also lost my last blog entry? soooooo, uhhh, considered that perma deleted?
				<span class="gap"></span> <span class="gap"></span> P.S P.S P.S I removed the zonelet css file ages ago
