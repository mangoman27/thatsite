		 <h3>08/03/2024</h3>
			<p>Sooooo, I know I promised more content but, I decided to also revamp the site's structure! I have added a long awaited, and much deserved sidebar for my posts and for the gallery.
			It needs some more ironing to remove some of the quirks, like the fact the two div's in the middle are smaller than the header and the footer, 
			but I'm sure I will get there. I also managed to make the site 100% mobile compatiable , albeit not erganomical.... I also removed ez photoviewer from gallery , 
			although it was an accident, I kinda prefer the site without it. It didn't rlly fit in with the theme I was goin' for anyways
			<span class="gap"></span> <span class="gap"></span> Edit: Literally, same day, I have fixed the width problem!

		 <h3>03/03/2024</h3>
			<p> 	So today I decided to procrastinate even more and I fixed some typo's in the previous posts , heck I even added a cute update message in the bottom right of each newly revised blog entry. I plan to add a seperate updates page because it seems I keep dumping them here, on the blog. <span class="gap"></span> <span class="gap"></span> Another thing to note is that the site is now 99% mobile compatible , that 1% is the title on the header saying when the site was last updated in general. I cant manage to get it to fit on mobile and applying an zero opacity filter in css does not seem to work, I think I know why its not working but I will likely solve it tomorrow or something.

		 <h3>02/03/2024</h3>
			<p> I have just created an seperate blog entry to the one below to express my excietment and joy  that my site has finally been crawled by google itself!!!! So you can now directly look it up on google, provided you type the full web address lol.

			<p> 
			
			
			So recently I was able to find a way to make a modular header and footer in js instead of php and today is the day I finally implement the update , 
			Huzzah indeed! Now this does bring up some problems I will need to iron out, meaning I cannot use js in the footer and header because apparently you cant
			include a js file inside another js file...... Who would’ve thought?! Oh well, i’m sure I will find a workaround sooner or later. 
			<span class="gap"></span> 
			<span class="gap"></span> 
			Now if you want to use this code for your own site, I will leave a simple template below to download because displaying it is a pain in the ass.
