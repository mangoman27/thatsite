<div style="display: flex;">
	   <img src="gbpanim.gif" style="width: 9vw;">
<p>Well, I'm a triple citizen living in the Uk. I came to the UK when i was 4 in 2012, so despite the perk of sounding like a foreigner, I'm as british as borris johnson! I enjoy light coding, web stuff and photography.
I like to collect antiques and I'm pretty socially inept. I think Paris sucks ass ( its the truth folks!) and my favourite city is istanbul. 
I would write more here but i'm terrible at that and honestly I don't know what else to write! If you have any questions about me, the site, or if ya just wanna chat, email me at lusitania@tuta.io

<h3>The Site</h3>

<p>So I have had a wish for a little bit of the internet pie since about mid 2022 but I never really ended up doing it because I would always keep creating site design's that i instantly disliked and because im terrible at producing coherant english (im a native speaker but an idiot lol).
However, last december I said fuck it and published this site, which although I do like, it sometimes makes me want to run for the hills because I feel the burning urge to 'revamp' the code for the billionth time, probabily because im a bad coder, probabily because im a perfectionist.
Because of what i previously mentioned, this site is likely to be a forever work in progress with likely to be infrequent posts.
